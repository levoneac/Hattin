Trying to build a chess engine from scratch by myself.

WIP, ~~currently finishing up the move generator.~~ Next up is implementing the UCI protocol so it can be used with a GUI. After that im starting to make the evaluator.

To run the current example in Program.cs, just do "dotnet run" in the directory (change to your .NET version in the csproj)
